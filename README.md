# System-Monitoring-Log-Analysis-Tool-in-Kali-Linux-VMware-

## Objective
[Brief Objective]

Developed a Bash script in Kali Linux (VMware) that automates system monitoring by logging CPU, memory, and disk usage every 60 seconds, demonstrating core skills in Linux scripting, automation, and log analysis.”

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points]

- Bash Scripting
- Log Analysis
- System Monitoring
- Process Management
- Virtualization (VMware)
- Linux Administration




### Tools Used
[Bullet Points]

- Kali Linux - A Linux distribution used for learning, scripting, and system administration. Provides a secure environment for testing and running scripts.
- VMware (Virtual Machine) – Creates a virtualized system, allowing you to run Kali Linux safely without affecting your host machine.
- Nano Editor – A simple command-line text editor for creating and editing scripts and configuration files.
- Linux Terminal – Provides a command-line interface to execute commands, run scripts, and manage the system.







## Steps
**I set up a Kali Linux virtual machine in VMware to create a safe, controlled environment for my system monitoring project. This allowed me to practice Linux administration and scripting without affecting my host system. I updated packages, installed monitoring tools, and used the VM to write and run my Bash script, showing I can deploy and manage virtualized operating systems**.![2025-11-11 10_34_06-kali-linux-2025.3-vmware-amd64 - VMware Workstation.png](https://github.com/matthewlpearson/System-Monitoring-Log-Analysis-Tool-in-Kali-Linux-VMware-/blob/6f2d844c0bd93354d7c22f89b859a31efe1d9a2b/2025-11-11%2010_34_06-kali-linux-2025.3-vmware-amd64%20-%20VMware%20Workstation.png)

**Here I’m inside the nano editor in Kali Linux, writing out my Bash script. This shows the actual code I created to automate system monitoring.**.![2025-11-11 09_52_55-kali-linux-2025.3-vmware-amd64 - VMware Workstation.png](
